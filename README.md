This project demonstrates the use of Hadoop MapReduce for analyzing Shakespeare's works and flight data, focusing on word count and flight carrier analyses. The workflow includes:

- **Hadoop Setup**: Initializing and starting Hadoop services.
- **Data Preparation**: Creating directories in HDFS and populating them with the datasets.
- **Project Compilation**: Using Maven to compile the project.
- **MapReduce Execution**: Running applications to analyze text and flight data, with details on how to execute these applications and view their output in HDFS.
- **Troubleshooting**: Accessing YARN and HDFS UIs for job monitoring and debugging.
